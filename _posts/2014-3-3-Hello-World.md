### Chapter 1 - Monsoon

#### The leeches come out in the rain to suck your bluuuuuuuhhhhd

There are many ways out of this.  Here are my favorites.  My two favorite ways to escape the maddening ruin of a severely aberrant mind. One way is neutralize it. Blow it out, quick!   Like the match flame that burned through the whole length of the habitually insubstantial wooden stick and had a brief intimate encounter with your finger tip. Take a big deep breath because you have to blow out all the candles if you want your wishes to come true. The second way out is to wait.  It's harder than the first way and much riskier.   There are no guarentees.  But take some comfort in this: nothing is safe from the relentless persistence of change.  Sooner or later things will be different. They could be better or even worse than they are now but it's better than things staying the same.   

These were my feverless sick head thoughts.  I was sitting hunched over on my bed, using my knee to prop up my bony congested chest. My little laptop was propped up on the bed frame, resting precariously on the edge with an expectant concrete floor a few feet below. My tiny room was dark. The only light came from a small window with wooden bars carved out of the mud walls. There had been a working light bulb but recently it blew up in an accident involving an electric kettle. The nearest supply store was only twenty minutes away and they probably had light bulbs. The roads were glistening with wet mud, fresh from recent landslides birthed by the monsoon rains. I thought it would be nice to go for a walk and get out of the dark for a little bit but the snot slowly dripping from my nose and the lurid aches behind my eyes said to wait. So I waited. I laid down, relenting unconsciously to the stealthy fog creeping over my thoughts and leaving the fate of the cirque de ole computer up to the whims of chance. Thunder in the misty gray sky resounded off the mountains like a metronome, counting the moments and confirming the passage of time. I closed my eyes and faded into a blurry place between wakefulness and sleep.

For the majority of my existence,  I have had a peculiar time of things. For some reason I could not figure out how to be a productive member of society.  I knew how it was supposed to be done, but could never maintain the enormous amount of sustained motivation that was necessary for this to be accomplished. Because I was a master of doing things I didn't want to do with the smallest amount of expended effort, this wasn't apparent to most people from the outside. By means still unknown to myself I had earned a master's degree from a reputable instate college and after a period of persuing miscellaneous employment had landed a job at the same university.  Sometimes I worked alone, sometimes with a few others collecting field samples and processing them in the lab. Things were good at first, like they always are. But since the time of adolescence I had unwillingly housed a mysterious force inside me that made it impossible for good things to last for very long. This force would go through varying lengths and degrees of hibernation and without fail awaken from its slumber in dire need of sustenance. Slowly it started draining away the essential life force, the motivation to do the things you are supposed to do in order to function like a good human. I had become aware of this presense and saw what it was doing but didn't have the will to stop it. I had tried so many times before but had now come to accept that resistance was futile. Maybe my supervisors saw it happening too or maybe not but with the next round of funding cuts my position was terminated. But I was happy!  From here there were endless possibilities, a plethora of choice. It seemed like the time had finally come for that one paramount decision. The one that makes all other choices of the past dim in their own insignificance. Having struggled at length with the incomprehensibility of life and failing repeatedly to form any meaningful connection to it I did what some other almost thirty year olds do in this situation and joined an organization that would send me to live far far away from where I lived now. My expectations were non-existent. I had recently discovered that life was better if you didn't have any expectations. It flowed a little smoother, reduced the drag and made the other problems a little easier to deal with.  I actually did have expectations but tried to pretend that I didn't.  But still, having half-heartedly and incompletely discarded my hopes and anxieties of the future I was not in the least bit prepared for the journey that laid ahead.

Can anyone ever really be prepared for anything? 

The Sky...

It sings with delicate totality

pervading into all that seems reality

In itself an illusion

light in vexed diffusion

But so tangibly perceivable

it's song is unmistakeable

Drawing up the soul from an empty well

into the quiet ease of blue pastel

There is no conflict here

no pain can thus endear

Changing always yet ever the same

pervading through thoughts' noxious reign

It's comely essence taken in sup

will free all fluster if you'll only look up!
