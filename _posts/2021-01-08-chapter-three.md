### Falling in Love with Falling Apart

#### Sometimes I let the leeches have a little blood because I love them.

For so long you have run from that for which you most long.

hiding from the thing that deep inside you quietly sings a gentle song.

When you turn around and stop to listen for a moment it fades away. replaced by all the other tunes you have also tried to flee for one too many days.

Too afraid to face alone the turbid sap that lives within your bones.

always clinging to your vices, giving in to all the vain enticing.

entranced so easily by the promise of escape, you rent away your heart even though you know what fate awaits.

But now your tired feet are dragging on the ground.  The pebbles that once grabbed at your lazy toes are boulders now that twist your weakened ankles and scrape against your scabby knees.  Will you keep going thus?  Will you carve through the mountains with your fingernails?  Until all the flesh is gone and your broken bones at last release that horrid song?

You know the time has come now to sit down and listen to the dissonant string of notes, to let them fill your ears with all their strife and woe.

For underneath the languid ache that makes your body quiver and quake

lies the latent sweetness, the nectar of your being that longs to hold you tight within its soft embraces.  Let the god damned cracked dam break.

Let it shatter! and carry away your ragged way that's left your mind in tatters.

With what little will you have face the deluge. And in its purging take your refuge.  Maybe then after all the darkened wax has been dissolved, will you hear the tender song that weaves together one; your soul of separateness absolved.

I started to let go.  To really let everything go.  It felt like waking up slowly.  Like floating out of a dream you have already started to forget.  Orientation.  Perceptance.  Daylight.  Warmth.  Connection.  I was still me but not in the same way.  Now there was a lot more here too.  I stopped feeling so separate from my surroundings.  From the other people always around me.  I started to feel like a part of some network outside of myself.  So much love.  For everything!  The children, who better than anyone else know how to be themselves.  Pinky the dog, my best friend.  Waiting for me to get up everyday.  Really starting to see everyone else.  And starting to see myself, every single part.  Walking around the village because I want to go talk to someone, anyone!  Who am I?  I love this place!  I love myself!  I love my life!  I'm not afraid anymore, I feel free to be me.  Sitting in a packed jeep squished together with everyone.  Even the ones I don't know or don't like.  In this moment I love them.  It's like a carnival ride and our fates are not our own anymore.  Singing along as we zoom around the mountains.  Holding someone's child, snug tight and safe in the back of the bus, falling asleep together.  I love this.  This precious moment.  This precious life.   Thank you.



Yes!  Stab the coals with all your destructive intent!  Splinter them into explosions with your unsatiable hunger for rebirth.

As pine is burning, oozing fragrant sappy smoke and feeding flames that turn our mushroom harvest into a meal prepared together, I feel I have fallen into the moment I had longed for before.  Longed for a life time.  Had but rarely fully realized.  The days appointed are meaningless.  The moments find you in their own time with their own whimsy.  

The essence that moves in all things.
the life and the love that it brings.
look and see.



Myna bird all fluffed and goofy, talking to someone I don't see, perched on the baby bhaisi buffalo's head.  Baby bhaisi's jaw lazily gnawing on some grass, its mouth slowly moving in a wide circle, with no care for the proclamations from above.
Old man walking around the village loop over and over all day.
Sunflower seeds!  Sprouting in the past infloresence of their mother.

The simal red silk cotton tree flowers fallen, resting on the ground now. From pre birth to glorious red eruptions their chronology unfurled.

The song of the mustard seed separating into oil and cake: toriko mill sings a slow base "desare" and pitter pattery "ali kati kaanaa kae".  The laugh of Sunita.  Her beautiful smile that makes it so her eyes can't hide the joy she feels.  Carrying the mustard seed in baskets on our backs.  Being a part of a group.  Walking together into town where the stares of people I don't know mean nothing because I belong now.

The celestial waters of kaka bessiko khola river sparkling with the kisses from the sun; tickling my soul and carrying away all that clings to the edges of the present.  Playing in the water with bahini sister after we do the laundry.  Aamaa politely telling the man working nearby to go somewhere else maybe.  The long walk uphill back home.  Together.

Standing pachadi in the back in the jeep releasing unfettered cries in ecstacy with women soaring on the wings of their remembered power.  Calling out to everyone we pass and laughing.  Dancing Singing, blaring the music.  Oh yeah its a party!  This moment is ours.

Cutting ghas grass with Aamaa.  Taking a break before we go back.  She found a curly piece of barlako vine tendril and is pretending it is a nose ring. :)  Making fun, bouncing side to side with that look on her face. She is just like my Mom right now.

The tap is broken again.  Carrying the gagri jug of water from the spring down the hill.  The strength in my neck is leaking out.  Its getting rubbery and I think it might snap.  They were right I can't do it.  Its too heavy, the road is too narrow and slippery and steep.  No!  I won't fall here, go quick!  It hurts so bad.  I cant think or feel anything but the pain.  We rest a moment, for a minute.  Its easier now but for a blink and then its harder than before.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  But my feet are still moving and my head is still on my neck.  Just go, let go, maybe you will make it.  Maybe... maybe you can do it.   The final stair of rocks, the last stretch of dirt road.  I made it, I made it!  Now the stairs that made my knees creek before feel like springs that push my feet off the cement in playful ease. I am dancing on the air.  My body is nearly weightless just as my cares for this moment I see.  Wow they are so strong.

The one.  The god of this earth.  Mother.  She is pure love and all the pain felt that comes from love.  She burns and melts away the coverings lain over your heart to show you the beauty of your nakedness.  All fear devoured as worldly experience becomes ethereal.  She is the soul in all that lives and maybe the true purpose of this life experience.  This experiment.

Eleven months left.  Measurable accomplishments unknown, unmeasurable accomplishments not reportable.  Definition of accomplishment vague and unsatisfying.  Many things have changed but the difficulty in enumerating precisely how or what has changed is like trying to identify and describe the plethora of species of bacteria in the soil without a microscope or any knowledge of bacterial taxonomy.

A little hide drum beats with sudden life for a second.  A traveling man will give you trinkets for your hair.  All the children run to trade for treasure!  Balloons and bracelets and pony tales!  With a neighbor who is being themself.  Wearing the color of the sky as it reaches for the sea.  Sharing in play and holding a moment of joy together.  Such power in these feelings that thoughts only in the present may reside.  The will to be anywhere else dissolved for a time.

Sunken once again into a deep despair and rescued by the life of this place.  No one dances here they said.  But I wanted to so my bahini told the children and they organized the gathering and brought their mothers.  I didn't think they were coming but they did.  My aamaa sang and danced because she knew it would make me happy.  And I hope it made her happy too.  Everyone gives so much.  I would have been lost still without them.

It's like this because you asked to see the truth.  But first you have to learn the truth about yourself.  It's painful to rip apart everything you've built up to protect your heart from harm.  Probably more painful now then just feeling the pain initially instead of letting it stain your insides charcoal like the smoke plastered kitchen ceiling.  Seeing and accepting your truth, looking into the hearts of your demons is like scrubbing the char off your tender flesh to see what has been lying underneath the whole time.

Love is losing yourself.  It is letting go completely and giving up.  Seeing how the ego becomes greedy sometimes when it doesn't feel loved.  Would I have learned this if i had stayed?  I don't know.  It would have been a lot different.  I wish I hadn't been so selfish all this time.  I feel so grateful for this clarity.  Please let it stay through the hard times.

Hearing the pigeons fly over my head - their wings cutting through the air.  Blue and black nail polish.  Letting the kids paint my fingernails and toes.  It looks terrible but I love it.  Nirgali, Anita, Acriti, Mausam and even Sarita being goofy and free.  Sitting with Pinky in the sunlight and sharing sounds of affection.  Thankful for the love people give.  Thankful for the way Kobita looks at me.  Like she wants me to know that she loves me.

Everything that I have experienced has been necessary to grow in this way.  All of the pain and fear and anger and despair are all needed to increase the capacity for love and peace and power to live with eyes open, with heart open.  Awareness.  It is the most precious gift. The one most of us don't even realize we have lost. You have been working so hard to show me.  To wake me up.  And you never give up on me.  No matter how many times I fall asleep or for how long.  You always wake me up again. Because when I'm awake we're together.

On the bus sitting next to Babaji in bright orange from head to toe, white lines and orange tika on his forehead.  He has been wandering for 8 years going to different temples.  Sukha dukha barabar.  Happiness sadness are equal.  The lines in my hand said god will be with me as i go.  He said it was good when he closed my fingers but sounded a little bit sad.  The other man behind us was in all white and there was something in his eyes.  The girl outside squatting on the bench talking to her friend with her hair like a happy elf. The egret and the bhaisi being friends together in the rice paddy.

Everyone being here together.  Really being here.  Really loving each other for who we all are.  I love you.  I have always loved you and I always will.  We all love you.  We love you. We need you.
