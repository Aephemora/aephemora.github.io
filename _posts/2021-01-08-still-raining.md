## Still Raining

### Leeches don't like the smell of _Zanthoxylum armatum_ - rub it on your ankles

I am sinking, drowning, dying,

falling down beneath the deep

I cannot sleep, I cannot keep

my sunken mind from panic's reach

They are coming, running, flying

hasting on into the night

I cannot hide; each place they'll find

me spewing off some saying trite

My tongue is melting, lips are freezing

sound betrays its proper wise

Not seeing, feeling; only hearing:

rearing my own demise

Consumed in the animus skies ablaze

fettered in ravaging cries and craze

Please! lest my soul be entwined

rip out my contemptuous mind.

The wind was so soft; like the caress of an incipient lovers' hand on your cheek before lips meet united in a purpose obscured by passion. Exhaustion melted the last thought in a head that could no longer sustain the spark of life - void now, only with eyes for the blue and the white dancing slow and sweet above the mountains. Completely here and entirely lost in the movements that seemed to make up everything. No longer a single mind, no longer any mind of any kind - just a thing feeling all the other things together.

I sat on a small woven stool that I had carried with me to a small clearing just outside of the outhouse. I came here most mornings soon after waking up. The original intention of this irregular routine had been to meditate but after a couple weeks I found that simply staring off into space was easier. It required no focused effort and was not entangled with purpose or intent. Sometimes I saw faces in the clouds and wondered if they were trying to talk to me. Sometimes I just cried - letting my emotions of unidentifiable descriptions eat away at anything trying to coexist with them. Sometimes I reveled in the ecstasy of contentment and flooded the sky with my gratitude for this moment of peace. Each time I sat down was different. This consistency of varied experiences became a comfort - a continuous source of change. It was when things stayed the same, or at least appeared to, that a stagnant discomfort began to tickle the edges of every thought like a fly that refuses to be deterred by any amount of shooing away.

The first few months living in a rural village of a foreign land passed in much the same way that the jeep ride passed to and from dc, the district capital. The road was treacherous and narrow; a single lane dirt road that hugged the side of steep aloof mountains that were not particularly emotional and didn't feel the need to return the hug. The road as a result felt hurt at having given so much affection for none of it to be returned. It fell into a neglected state unmotivated to take care of basic needs. It became riddled with potholes, mud pits and eroded channels. There were landslides in places where the mountain was trying to pry itself free from the needy grasp of desperate infatuation. The relationship was doomed from the start and probably never should have been forged in the first place. But then how would people get to dc to enjoy some of the most interesting ice cream in all of the world? Ever eat unmelted ice cream that's not cold? It's interesting and feels like marshmallows that have been partially deconstructed at the atomic level. So clearly it was necessary to journey through the emotionally unstable and unhealthy relationship of dirt and rock in order to taste the truth of complete absurdity. Unlike the creamy anomaly, smooth was not an adjective that fit anywhere close to the description of the jeep ride. It could maybe be likened to riding a mechanical bull inside a small metal box with lots of metal things to hit your head on. There are also 20 other people riding with me and sometimes we throw up in little plastic bags and throw the warm packages out the windows that sometimes dangle over the edge of a cliff. Also it is always very loud because while driving in such intimate companionship with death it helps to be blasting your favorite tunes. These were pretty much all of the things I hated all clumped together with nothing that I particularly liked. I wasn't having a very good time despite my best efforts to try. Can you convince yourself that you like the things you have always hated? I couldn't. Although it was pretty funny just how much chaos could fit into such a small space. It started to erode the roads of sanity between the neurons in my head so that I laughed and laughed at how extreme and inescapable my discomfort was. In a crazed and fearless challenge I dared the jeep to fly off the cliff and smiled at the thought of the blaring pop music coming to an abrupt and permanent end. What does the death of sanity feel like? It feels great. And it tastes like foamy ice cream that has a problem with authority so decided to ignore the law of thermodynamics.

Soggy lumps that once were thoughts

Slimy lumps that glisten in their rot

Oh how many here have found a place to be!

With nothing - no one else to make them do a thing

An oblong limb emerges from a formless mass

to stretch a bit after having such a lovely nap

Gooey browns and greens beneath a few long bristles

slurp and glurp and burb as out their insides trickle

They breed: their seed infesting the ravenous cavernous hole

that once gave life and flight to a boundless tumultuous soul

Now here they be for no one to see

for nothing to dictate or make some decree

Just hangin around with no purpose abound

A fate for such things mayhap can't be found.
